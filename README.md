# AI_assignements
This repo is my assignments for the introduction to AI course. 

# Assignement 1

I was provided with a synthetic dataset: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turcotte/csi4106-f25/main/assignments-data/a1/alien_pet_health.csv 

It contains some attributes related to the health indicators of aliens. The assignement 1 evolves around cleaning data and preparing the data to be analyzed in assignement2 where a model
is trained to detect whether a certain individual is healthy or not depending on certain indicators. You can execute the notebook in google collab. The alien_pet_health_cleaned.csv 
is the result of the data cleaning and the statistical analysis of the first assignement.
